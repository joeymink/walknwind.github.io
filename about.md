A friend of mine challenged me to start a Jekyll blog. So BOOM! Here it is.

I'm a software engineer who, like many, have found that there is no way to remain insulated from system administration, network administration, and deployment tasks. Especially at small companies. So I've embraced reality and have found some happy places in certain tools, tricks, methods, and ideas. I hope to share those here!

And ... scene.
