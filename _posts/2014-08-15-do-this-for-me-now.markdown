There is no idea more powerful than this:

_Do this for me now._

Regardless of the current context, just:

_Do this for me now._

I live this dream every day with [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) on OSX. Issue a keystroke, type what I want into the text field, hit enter. BOOM. I use this for so many things -- launching applications, finding contacts, playing music...

But Alfred's "Workflows" are where the real power comes in. You specify a keyword, an argument to go with the keyword (if necessary), and tell Alfred what to do when that input is given. There are a few canned "Actions", one of which allows you to run a script in Terminal.

I'm still an amateur with Alfred's Workflows, but what little I've accomplished with them has made my life much easier. I use Workflows to up/down EC2 instances, launch SourceTree on specific Git repos, etc. And I do this from anywhere at any time - keystroke, type a word or two, BOOM.

No matter when, no matter where, and without back-talk, Alfred does my bidding. I <3.
