Have you met him?

    git init

This guy's one of my best friends. He doesn't know it, but I do. I mean, who wouldn't love him? I'm in the middle of doing something - writing a script, setting values in a configuration file. Before you know it, I've ``:wq``'d like fifty times and I don't know where I've been. So right here, right now,

    git init

There are a million reasons to love Git, but this one is my favorite. It's the culmination of Git's ease-of-use and power. For one file, for a thousand,

    git init

and start creating some history as you work without any complex configuration or standing-up of infrastructure. If you get where you want to be, and you don't care anymore how you got there, ``rm -r .git`` and move on. At least you were able to create an infinitely large desk while you got to that point.
